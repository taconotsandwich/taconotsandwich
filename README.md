# Hey there, I'm taco

I build games, break things, and occasionally write code that works (Hopefully).

## What I Do

I spend most of my time making games with Unity and participating in game jams. When I'm not doing that, I'm probably tinkering with tools or working on coursework.

## Tech Stack

- Game Development: Unity, C#
- Languages: TypeScript, C++, Rust
- Currently exploring: Agentic AI tools for game development
